Running 2019-2020.

The [TestDaF Institute](https://www.testdaf.de) is one of the biggest providers of language proficiency testing for German as a foreign language. LTL collaborates with the TestDaF institutes on automatic and assisted scoring of free-form answers, more precisely answers given to listening comprehension prompts and learner essays. We explore way how the the scoring workload of humans graders can be reduced and how we can ensure fast and consistent scoring of free text answers.
