An alternative approach that receives much less attention is however to learn a similarity-based model. We introduce an architecture that efficiently learns a similarity model and find that results on the standard ASAP dataset are on par with a BERT-based classification approach.",

We cluster a recently released corpus through topic modeling into prompts and train argument identification models on different data settings. Results show that, given the same amount of training data, prompt-specific training performs better than cross-prompt training. However, the advantage can be overcome by introducing large amounts of cross-prompt training data.",

When judging whether a variant is acceptable or not, human raters perform a complex holistic decision. In this paper, we present a corpus study in which we analyze human acceptability decisions in a high stakes test for German. We show that for human experts, spelling variants are harder to score consistently than other answer variants.Furthermore, we examine how the decision can be operationalized using features that could be applied by an automatic scoring system. We show that simple measures like edit distance and phonetic similarity between a given answer and the target answer can model the human acceptability decisions with the same inter-annotator agreement as humans, and discuss implications of the remaining inconsistencies.",

However, studies show that news, in general, has a significant impact on our mental stature and that this influence is more in bad news. An ideal situation would be that we have a tool that can help to filter out the type of news we do not want to consume. In this paper, we provide the basis for such a tool. In our work, we focus on Twitter. We release a manually annotated dataset containing 6,853 tweets from 5 different topical categories. Each tweet is annotated with good and bad labels. We also investigate various machine learning systems and features and evaluate their performance on the newly generated dataset. We also perform a comparative analysis with sentiments showing that sentiment alone is not enough to distinguish between good and bad news.",

News from social media is potentially useful for various stakeholders including aid organizations, news agencies, and individuals. However, social media also contains a vast amount of non-news content. For users to be able to draw on benefits from news reported on social media it is necessary to reliably identify news content and differentiate it from non-news. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of classifying a social post as news or not. To this end, we provide a new manually annotated dataset containing 2,992 tweets from 5 different topical categories. Unlike earlier datasets, it includes postings posted by personal users who do not promote a business or a product and are not affiliated with any organization. We also investigate various baseline systems and evaluate their performance on the newly generated dataset. Our results show that the best classifiers are the SVM and BERT models.",

abstract = {Implementations of word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms tend to be tied to a particular test corpus format and sense inventory. This makes it difficult to test their performance on new data sets, or to compare them against past algorithms implemented for different data sets. In this paper we present DKPro WSD, a freely licensed, general-purpose framework for WSD which is both modular and extensible. DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported.},

To discover targets, we use a measure of semantic relatedness between texts. We nd that semantic relatedness is useful to identify targets for ambiguous link anchors. In collections that contain no existing links, using only document titles as anchor candidates can be enhanced by using arbitrary noun phrases extracted from documents.},

abstract = {A table-of-contents (TOC) provides a quick reference to a document's content and structure. We present the first study on identifying the hierarchical structure for automatically generating a TOC using only textual features instead of structural hints e.g. from HTML-tags. We create two new datasets to evaluate our approaches for hierarchy identification. We find that our algorithm performs on a level that is sufficient for a fully automated system. For documents without given segment titles, we extend out work by auto matically generating segment titles. We make the datasets and our experimental framework publicly available in order to foster future research in TOC generation.},

We provide an analysis of the important parameters of ESA using datasets in five different languages. Additionally, we propose the use of ESA with multiple lexical semantic resources thus exploiting multiple evidence of term cooccurrence to improve over the Wikipedia-based measure. Exploiting the improved robustness and coverage of the proposed combination, we report improved performance over single resources in word semantic relatedness, solving word choice problems, classification of semantic relations between nominals, and text similarity.},
