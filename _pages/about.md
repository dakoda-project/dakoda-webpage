Welcome to the Language Technology Lab!


We conduct research in the field of language technology and natural language processing.
We are especially interested in analyzing and processing non-standard, error-prone language as found in social media and learner language.
Consequently, our research can be divided into three main areas:

Educational NLP

* Short answer scoring
* Essay scoring
* Vocabulary acquisition
* Spelling and grammar correction
* Exercise generation
* Exercise difficulty prediction

Social Media Analysis

* Sentiment and stance detection
* Argument mining
* Detection of hate speech and abusive language
* Semantic meaning relations

NLP Engineering

* Robustness of tools
* Domain adaption
* Large-scale semantic processing

We are committed to reproducible and replicable research. We generally make all research software publicly available.
