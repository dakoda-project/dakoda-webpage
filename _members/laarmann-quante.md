As a computational linguist, I work on automatically analyzing and evaluating texts from learners. My goal is to create applications based on language technology and artificial intelligence that support learning and assessment processes. 

Texts written by learners often differ greatly from supposedly "perfect" newspaper language; for example, they contain orthographic and grammatical errors. From a computational linguistics perspective, this is both a challenge and an opportunity. My goal is to gain insights into learning processes by automatically analyzing such texts and to develop applications to support learners and teachers in practice.

#### Research Interests

- How can learner texts be processed robustly by the computer?
- What role do, e.g., spelling errors play in the evaluation of answers?
- What insights can we gain from the computational linguistic analysis of texts about learning processes, e.g., in (written) language acquisition?
- How can learners and teachers be supported by language technology applications?

#### Short CV

- Research Assistant at the professorship Computational Linguistics in the Research Cluster „Digitalization, Diversity and Lifelong Learning – Consequences for Higher Education“ (D²L²) at the FernUniversität in Hagen since April 2022
- PhD in Computational Linguistics at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum (2020)
- Research Assistant at the Language Technology Lab at the Universität Duisburg-Essen (2019-2022)
- Research Assistant in the interdisciplinary research project "Literacy as the key to social participation: Psycholinguistic perspectives on orthography instruction and literacy acquisition" at the Department of Linguistics at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum
- Master of Arts in Linguistics (focus Computational Linguistics) at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum (2015)
- Bachelor of Arts in English Studies and Linguistics (focus Computational Linguistics) at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum (2013)
